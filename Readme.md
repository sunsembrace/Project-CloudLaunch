#Just realised We need to fix our kubernetes. First issue is mismatch of documentation templates between deployment and service. Need to make sure pod labels app names match deployment had just "app" wherreas service template had "app.kubernetes.io/name" - MUST DO THIS I THINK THIS IS SOLUTION, BUT THERES ALSO ANOTHER ISSUE INTERMS OF TYPE MISSING AT FINAL LINE?
